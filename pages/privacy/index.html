            <p>
                This Privacy Policy explains what personal data is processed when you use KanMind and for what purpose.
                “Personal data” means any information that can be related to you (e.g., name, email address, IP

            <p>
                When you access this website/app, the hosting provider and/or server automatically processes information
                in so-called server log files. This may include:
            </p>

                <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests).<br>
                <strong>Retention:</strong> log data is stored only as long as necessary for security and
                troubleshooting
                and is then deleted or anonymized, unless legal obligations require longer retention.
