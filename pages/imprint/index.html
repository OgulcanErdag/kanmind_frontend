            <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
            <p>
                As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages in accordance with general
                laws
                pursuant to § 7 para. 1 TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, I am not obligated to monitor
                transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal
                activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.
                Liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation.
                If I become aware of such violations, I will remove the content immediately.

            <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
            <p>
                This website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content I have no influence.
                Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or
                operator
                of the linked pages is always responsible for their content.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time of linking, the linked pages were checked for possible legal violations. Illegal content
                was not identifiable at the time of linking. Permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is
                not reasonable without concrete indications of a violation of the law. If I become aware of any legal
                infringements, such links will be removed immediately.
